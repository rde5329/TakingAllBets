# Taking All Bets

## I. Concept
A gladiatorial fight simulation that the player bets on to win more money

## II. Genre
Strategy, Simulation, Productivity

## III. Platform
Desktop web browsers

## IV. Story
The player will be able to see the basic stats of randomly generated
gladiators that are going to fight. Then they can bet money on who they
think is going to be the winner. There will also be a rival who is
trying to beat the player

## V. Esthetics
Graphics: pixely, with a lot of looping between GUIs
Sound: maybe some light hearted tavern music? but its going to be a strech goal

##  VI. Gameplay
The gameplay will mostly follow a repeated process that changes the 
more times the player goes through it. The player will bet some of 	
their money in the beginning of each fight, the rival will counter the
player's bet, if the player can successfully get the rival down to no
money, they win

The game will be a lot of just menu screens because of how the game is. 
Depending on time constrants, I may add more into the gladiators than
randomizing stats and fighting, like rumors, or some more added effort
onto them

The controls will mostly just be clicking buttons and typing numbers, the
player will be given generic odds of the fight before so they aren't just
given a choice between two people with no info at all. It may be a small
description of both fighters and based on those, the odds will be made

## IX. About the Developer

Robley Evans, Game Design and Development major, French minor, 2nd year

I'm pretty decent at learning code and molding ideas and concepts together in 
efficient ways to make sure I can accomplish what I need to get done. Also, 
I'm pretty good at looking things up to learn what I need, then using those,
I can come up with even new and fresh ideas for myself.

Intrests are games in general. I love RPG's but I don't really have any genres
of games that I hate. I play what I'm in the mood for. I play lots of board games
and table top games too and I'm always trying to play new things to add to
my library of game knowledge.
